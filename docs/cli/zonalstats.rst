zonalstats
----------

``zonalstats`` (or ``zs``) computes zonal statistics of an input raster. The zones are defined by 
a vector file (shapefile, geojson, etc.). If no vector file is provided, the statistics are 
computed on the whole image.

Statistics inside a geometry can be computed for different categories also defined by a vector
file. For instance, is is possible to compute the average height of buildings and vegetation of
cities using:

- a Digital Height Model (input raster file)
- a shapefile with the boundaries of cities (-g argument)
- a shapefile with the buildings / vegetation classification (--category_file)

                                inputs [inputs ...]

  Compute zonal statistics of a raster image.

  Available statistics are: min, max, range, mean, std, percentile_x (x in [0,
  100]), median, mad, count, valid, nodata, sum, majority, minority, unique.

  By default, only the first band is computed unless specified otherwise.

  Arguments:

    inputs TEXT

    Raster files to process. You can provide a single filewith extension
    ".lst" (e.g. "zonalstats.lst") that lists the input files to process
    (one input file per line in .lst)

  Options:
    -o, --output TEXT           Output directory to store results (by default
                                current directory)
    -f, --format TEXT           Output format of the results when input
                                geometries are provided (by default ESRI
                                Shapefile). Possible values are ESRI Shapefile,
                                GeoJSON, CSV, GPKG, GML
    -g, --geometry TEXT         List of geometries where to compute statistics
                                (vector like a shapefile or geojson)
    -w, --within                When activated, statistics are computed for the
                                geometries that are within the raster shape. The
                                default behaviour otherwise is to compute
                                statistics for all geometries that intersect the
                                raster shape.
    --stats TEXT                List of stats to compute. Possible stats are:
                                min max range mean std percentile_x (x in [0,
                                100]) median mad count valid nodata sum majority
                                minority unique
    --categorical               If the input raster is categorical (i.e. raster
                                values represent discrete classes) compute the
                                counts of every unique pixel values.
    --valid_threshold FLOAT     Minimum percentage of valid pixels in a shape to
                                compute its statistics.
    --area                      Whether to multiply all stats by the area of a
                                cell of the input raster.
    --prefix TEXT               Add a prefix to the keys (default: None). One
                                prefix per band (e.g. 'band1 band2')
    -b, --bands INTEGER         List of bands to process
    -a, --all                   Process all bands
    --sigma TEXT                Distance to the mean value (in sigma) in order
                                to produce a raster that highlights outliers.
    -c, --chart TEXT            Generate a chart per stat and per geometry
                                (x=timestamp of the input products / y=stat
                                value) and store it in the file defined by this
                                argument
    -d, --display               Display the chart
    -gi, --geometry-index TEXT  Name of the geometry index used for the chart
                                (default='ID')
    --category_file TEXT        File (raster or geometries) containing discrete
                                classes classifying the ROI.
    --category_index TEXT       Column name identifying categories in
                                categroy_file (only if file format is
                                geometries)
    --category_names TEXT       JSON files containing a dict with classes index
                                as keys and names to display classes as values.
    -h, --help                  Show this message and exit.


When -g option is set with a valid geometries file, ``zonalstats`` generate a new vector file with the following metadata:

- [prefix].name : name of the band (if available in the input raster)
- [prefix].date : date of the input raster (if the raster has one of the configured raster types, either a built-in raster
  type or an additional custom raster type)
- [prefix].[stat] : values of the statistics
- [prefix].[pixel] : count of pixels having value = [pixel] when the categorical option is activated
- [prefix].[category][stat] : values of the statistics for the category [category] when the category_names option is activated.

With :

- [prefix] : prefix defined in the command line. If not set in the command line: b[band_number]
- [stat] : name of the statistics, e.g. mean, std

If no vector file is set in the command line, the statistics are stored in a new vector file that contains a single entry
whose geometry is the raster shape (without the zones of nodata).

Examples:

The following examples use an input raster file generated by radioindice. This is an NDVI of a SENTINEL2 L2A THEIA image that
covers most of the cities we are interested in.

.. image:: ../_static/SENTINEL2A_20180928-105515-685_L2A_T30TYP_D-ndvi-geoms.jpg

The first command generates statistics of ndvi values for several cities

.. code-block:: console

  $ rastertools zs -f GeoJSON -g COMMUNE_32.geojson --stats min max mean std SENTINEL2A_20180928-105515-685_L2A_T30TYP_D-ndvi.tif

This generates a new vector file that contains for each entity the stats values.

.. image:: ../_static/SENTINEL2A_20180928-105515-685_L2A_T30TYP_D-ndvi-stats.jpg

Notice that some cities are partially covered by the input raster and their statistics are thus probably not fully relevant.
To disable the computation for these cities, use option --within.

.. code-block:: console

  $ rastertools zs -f GeoJSON -g COMMUNE_32.geojson --within --stats min max mean std SENTINEL2A_20180928-105515-685_L2A_T30TYP_D-ndvi.tif

The new vector file is now:

.. image:: ../_static/SENTINEL2A_20180928-105515-685_L2A_T30TYP_D-ndvi-stats2.jpg

Let's use another raster file that corresponds to a land cover map named OSO. In this map, every pixel has
a value that represents its class (for instance: 1=dense urban area).

The following command line enables to count the pixels of every classes:

.. code-block:: console

  $ rastertools zs -f GeoJSON --categorical OCS_2017_CESBIO.tif

The generated vector file contains one geometry (a green square that corresponds to the shape of the
input raster) with the number of pixels for each category:

.. image:: ../_static/oso-stats.jpg
